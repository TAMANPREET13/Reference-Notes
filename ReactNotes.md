# React.js
React makes building complex,interactive and reactive user interfaces simpler.React is all about components
* Because all user interfaces in the end are made up of components


## Components:-

* Components in the end are a mixture of html code,css code and     possibily javascript code for some logic
  
* One of traits of component is it is reusable

# JSX
JSX stands for javascript xml because html is xml in the end.
We can write html straight in the .js file because it is converted into
javascript code in the backend .We dont need to write repeatitive code.
This is called imperitive approch . When we write all instruction in javascript

* With react we buid are own custom html elemnets


#### A component in react is just a javascript function.

* Components are function that return html code.
* A component can return only 1 root element so if we want to return more we must wrap them around a duv element.
